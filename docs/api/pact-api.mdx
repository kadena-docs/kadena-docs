# Pact endpoints

The Pact REST API is a powerful interface for interacting with smart contracts on the Kadena blockchain. 
It provides developers with a set of endpoints to execute contract functions, query blockchain state, and manage transactions efficiently.

## Key features

The Pact REST API offers six core functionalities, each designed to facilitate different aspects of blockchain interaction:

- **Send**: Submit transactions to the blockchain for execution.
- **Local**: Execute read-only queries or simulate transactions without affecting the blockchain state.
- **Listen**: Set up listeners for specific blockchain events or transaction results.
- **Poll**: Check the status of previously submitted transactions.
- **SPV**: Verify transaction inclusion using Simple Payment Verification.
- **Blockchain Queries**: Retrieve detailed information about blocks, transactions, and network state.

These features enable developers to build robust decentralized applications (dApps) that can interact seamlessly with the Kadena blockchain.

Each section provides detailed documentation, including endpoint descriptions, parameter explanations, and example requests and responses. 
Whether you're building a simple dApp or a complex blockchain application, these resources will guide you through effectively utilizing the Pact REST API.

## Getting started

To begin using the Pact REST API:

1. Familiarize yourself with the Pact smart contract language.
2. Set up your development environment with necessary tools and libraries.
3. Explore the documentation sections below to understand each API functionality.
4. Start with simple queries using the 'local' endpoint before moving to transaction submissions.

Remember, the Pact REST API is designed to be intuitive and developer-friendly. 
Don't hesitate to experiment with different endpoints to fully grasp their capabilities.
