The Chainweb **service API** allows querying and control of Chainweb nodes by clients outside of the blockchain network.
For example, other clients might include mining pools, decentralized services, web applications, exchanges, wallets, and so on.
Node operators must explicitly enable access to the service API and expose its endpoints on a different network interface than the peer-to-peer API.
The specific service API endpoints that are exposed for any node depend on the node configuration settings.

If you're a node operator, you can enable service API endpoints using configuration settings for the Chainweb node. 
The endpoints are served on a separate port over the unencrypted Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 
As a node operator, you can also choose to expose the endpoints locally or through reverse proxies, load balancers, authentication frameworks, and other similar web technologies.

## Key features and use cases

The Chainweb API is essential for various blockchain operations and analysis:

1. **Node Information**: Access detailed information about individual nodes in the network.
2. **Block and Transaction Data**: Retrieve comprehensive data about blocks and transactions across Kadena's multi-chain architecture.
3. **Network Statistics**: Gather real-time statistics about the Kadena network's performance and state.
4. **Peer-to-Peer Network Interaction**: Manage and monitor connections between nodes in the Kadena network.
5. **Chain-Specific Queries**: Perform targeted queries on specific chains within Kadena's parallel chain structure.
6. **Mining Operations**: Access endpoints relevant for miners and mining pool operators.

These features make the Chainweb API particularly valuable for developers building infrastructure tools, block explorers, analytics platforms, and other applications requiring deep blockchain data access.

### Endpoints

The Chainweb service API includes the following types of endpoints:

- Full block header and payload endpoints
- Block hash endpoints
- Block header endpoints
- Node and network health endpoints
- Mining service endpoints
- Pact REST API endpoints
- Rosetta endpoints

### Base URL

Because the service API is configurable for individual nodes, the base URL for service API endpoints can vary.
For bootstrap nodes, service API endpoints typically take the form of `api.<hostname>/chainweb/0.0/mainnet01` where the `<hostname>` is the IP address or domain name of a Chainweb node in the Kadena public blockchain network. 
Similarly, the base URL for service API endpoints in the Kadena test network is typically `api.testnet.<hostname>/chainweb/0.0/testnet04` where the `<hostname>` is the IP address or domain name of a Chainweb node in the Kadena test network.
If you're running a local development environment, you can typically replace `<hostname>` with `localhost:8080` to connect to the API and, if necessary, specify `development` as the network name.

Note that the Pact endpoints for any given chain identifier use the route prefix `/chain/{chainId}/pact/` in addition to the base URL.
For more information about Pact endpoints, see the [Pact API](/api/pact-api) or the [Pact OpenAPI](https://api.chainweb.com/openapi/pact.html) specification.

### Resource consumption and vulnerability

Some service API endpoints can require considerable resources on the server side,
Service API endpoints are also more vulnerable to denial-of-service (DOS) attacks.
In most cases, you should avoid exposing service endpoints to the public internet and use firewall rules or access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
