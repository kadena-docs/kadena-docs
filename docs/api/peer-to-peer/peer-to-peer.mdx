title: Peer-to-peer endpoints
id: p2p-api

The **peer-to-peer (P2P) API** contains the RPC endpoints that Chainweb nodes must expose to establish blockchain consensus. 
These endpoints enable nodes to communicate about transactions waiting in the transaction pool and the blocks being produced. 
Although the peer-to-peer endpoints are intended primarily for communication between Chainweb nodes, they are also useful in providing low level insight into network operations, the progress of the blockchain, and node health.
Peer-to-peer endpoints are typically more efficient than similar service API endpoints for most use cases.
However, peer-to-peer endpoints only expose features that are required for the peer-to-peer network to function.
For most use cases, you should send API requests to service API endpoints.

Each computer running `chainweb-node` serves peer-to-peer endpoints using the secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) on a network interface and port that is available directly on the public internet.

You can also make P2P API endpoints available for other clients by exposing the endpoints using reverse proxies, load balancers, authentication frameworks, or similar web technologies.

## Endpoints

The Chainweb peer-to-peer API includes endpoints to return information about the following aspects of the peer-to-peer network:

- Distributed state using [`cut` endpoints](/api/peer-to-peer/get-cut)
- Raw block payload using [`payload` endpoints](/api/peer-to-peer/get-payload)
- Pending transaction using [`mempool` endpoints](/api/peer-to-peer/all-pending-mempool)
- Peer-to-peer connections using [`peer` endpoints](/api/peer-to-peer/cut-peer)
- Node configuration using the [`config` endpoint](/api/peer-to-peer/config)

For peer-to-peer connections, Chainweb nodes have two separate communication channels with specialized independent peer-to-peer networks that different nodes can be part of:

- The `/peer/cut` peer-to-peer network is responsible for communicating the consensus state across the distributed network nodes. 
- The `/peer/mempool` peer-to-peer network is responsible for queuing and managing the pending transactions for each chain independently. 

## Base URL

The base URL for peer-to-peer API endpoints typically take the form of `<hostname>/chainweb/0.0/mainnet01` where the `<hostname>` is the IP address or domain name of a Chainweb node in the Kadena public blockchain network. 
Similarly, the base URL for peer-to-peer endpoints in the Kadena test network is typically `<hostname>/chainweb/0.0/testnet04` where the `<hostname>` is the IP address or domain name of a Chainweb node in the Kadena test network.
If you're running a local development environment, you can typically replace `<hostname>` with `localhost:8080` to connect to the API and specify `development` as the network name.
