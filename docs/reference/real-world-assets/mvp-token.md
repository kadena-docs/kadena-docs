# mvp-token

The [`mvp-token`](https://github.com/kadena-io/RWA-token/blob/main/mvp/mvp-token.pact) contract is an example of a real-world asset (RWA) token that can be configured with custom compliance rules for `mint`, `burn`, and `transfer` operations.

This sample contract implements Kadena RWA token standard interfaces that are defined in the following modules:

- [real-world-asset-v1](https://github.com/kadena-io/RWA-token/blob/main/contracts/real-world-asset/real-world-asset-v1.pact)
- [agent-role-v1](https://github.com/kadena-io/RWA-token/blob/main/contracts/roles/agent-role-v1.pact)
- [identity-registry-v1](https://github.com/kadena-io/RWA-token/blob/main/contracts/roles/agent-role-v1.pact)
- [compliance-compatible-v1](https://github.com/kadena-io/RWA-token/blob/main/mvp/compliances/compliance-compatible-v1.pact)

The `mvp-token` contract extends the functionality defined in the Kadena `fungible-v2` interface to demonstrate customized `mint`, `burn`, `transfer`, and `forced-transfer` operations for tokens.
The contract also provides `pause` and `freeze` functions to demonstrate restricting operations for an entire contract or specific investor accounts. 
In addition to the functions for managing tokens, the `mvp-token` contract implements agent roles to enforce transaction signature requirement and an identity registry to manage investor identities and account information. 
However, the contract doesn't implement identity verification.

Because the contract implements the `compliance-compatible-v1` interface, you can add one or more compliance contracts to customize the rules for `mint`, `burn`, abd `transfer` operations.
The `mvp-token` contract provides the following sample compliance contracts to demonstrate practical use cases:

- [max-balance-compliance-v1](https://github.com/kadena-io/RWA-token/blob/main/mvp/compliances/max-balance-compliance-v1.pact)
- [max-investors-compliance-v1](https://github.com/kadena-io/RWA-token/blob/main/mvp/compliances/max-investors-compliance-v1.pact)
- [supply-limit-compliance-v1](https://github.com/kadena-io/RWA-token/blob/main/mvp/compliances/supply-limit-compliance-v1.pact)

## Governance

The `mvp-token` contract defines two types of owners:

| Type | Defined as | Description |
| :--- | :--------- | :---------- |
| Governance | `GOV-KEYSET` | Identifies the primary module owner responsible for contract upgrades and initialization. The `GOV` capability enforces ownership using `(enforce-keyset GOV-KEYSET)` statement. |
| Operational owner | `owner-guard` | Specifies the account registered during contract initialization and granted access to specific operational functions. You can update the `owner-guard` after registration by calling the `transfer-ownership` function. The operational owner is enforced by the `(only-agent "owner")` function. For more information about this function and other predefined roles, see [Agent roles](#agent-roles).|

## Initialization

Use `init` to initialize the `mvp-token` contract with the following information:

- Token owner-guard
- Token name
- Token symbol
- Token decimal precision
- Kadena on-chain identifier for the owner identity
- Compliance module references
- Paused state

### Requirements

The **signer** for an `init` transaction must be the `GOV-KEYSET` governance capability owner with the `GOV` capability.

### Input parameters

Use the following input parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-------- | :--- | :---------- |
| name | string | Name of the token being initialized.|
| symbol | string | Symbol to use for the token being initialized.|
| decimals | integer | Decimal precision for the token being initialized.|
| kadenaID | string | Optional placeholder identity for the owner of the token being initialized.|
| compliance | `[module{RWA.compliance-v1}]` | Compliance rules to apply for the token being initialized. |
| paused | bool | Initial state for the token being initialized. |
| owner-guard | guard | Guard for the identity that owns the token being initialized. |

### State changes

The `init` function makes the following state changes:

- Registers token metadata in the `token` table using the values you specify for the input parameters.
- Sets the paused state to true or false based on `paused` input parameter.
- Assigns owner guard to authorize operational control for the specified `owner-guard` input parameter.
- Initializes the specified `compliance` modules with default compliance parameters.

### Events

The `init` function emits the following events:

- UPDATED-TOKEN-INFORMATION with the parameters `name`, `symbol`, `MINIMUM-PRECISION`, `VERSION`, and `kadenaID`.
- COMPLIANCE-PARAMETERS with the default compliance parameters for the compliance modules applied to the token.
- COMPLIANCE-UPDATED with the list of compliance modules.

### Error codes

The `init` function reports the following errors:

- CMPL-DUP-001 if there are duplicate compliance modules in the input parameters.

## Transaction signatures and agent roles

In the `mvp-token` contract, many of the functions that enable you to control token transfers or manage identities require the transactions where they are called to be signed by a registered **agent** or token **owner**.
Some functions also require the agent or owner signing the transaction to have been assigned a specific role and be granted specific capabilities. 

- Use [`add-agent`](#add-agent) to register and assign one or more roles to the agent.
- Use [`remove-agent`](#remove-agent) to remove a previously register agent.

### Agent roles

You can assign the following roles to an agent:

- `agent-admin` grants administrative rights to enable an agent to sign transactions that execute protected functions.
- `freezer` grants an agent permission to pause and resume token transfer operations, to freeze and unfreeze specific investor addresses, and to freeze and unfreeze a specific number of tokens for specific addresses.
- `transfer-manager` grants an agent permission to mint, burn, and forcibly transfer tokens.

You assign roles as part of the transaction data when you submit a transaction request to perform a specific operation.

### Role enforcement

Roles are enforcement by calling the following functions:

- `only-agent` ensures that the caller signs the (ONLY-AGENT "agent-role") managed capability with a registered agent guard.
  The agent address is retrieved from the data field, rather than passed as a parameter.
  Note that the `owner` role—for example, (ONLY-AGENT "owner")—can only be added when calling the `init` or `transfer-ownership` function, can only be assigned to one address, and is retrieved directly from the table.

- `only-owner-or-agent-admin` ensures that the caller signs either as an agent with role `agent-admin` or as the `owner` role.

## add-agent

Use `add-agent` to add a new agent or reactivate an existing agent that's not currently active.
