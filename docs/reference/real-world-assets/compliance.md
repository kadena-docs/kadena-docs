The `mvp-token` contract uses the `compliance-compatible-v1` interface to apply custom compliance rules to the token supply for tokens that represent physical assets or financial instruments that have specific compliance requirements.

The sample compliance contracts define the following compliance rules:

- Total token supply limit (`supply-limit-compliance-v1`).
- Maximum balance allowed for each investor (`max-balance-compliance-v1`).
- Maximum number of investors allowed (`max-investors-compliance-v1`).

Each sample compliance contract implements the [`compliance-v1`](https://github.com/kadena-io/RWA-token/blob/main/contracts/compliance/compliance-v1.pact) interface.
The interface defines the core capabilities and function signatures for binding and unbinding tokens to the contract rules and the compliance checks required for different token operations.

## Capabilities

The `mvp-token` contract defines the following capabilities:

| Capability | Implementation&nbsp;required | Description |
| :--------- | :---------------------- | :---------- |
| COMPLIANCE-UPDATED | | Tracks updates to compliance settings.|
| COMPLIANCE-PARAMETERS | | Authorizes compliance parameter changes.|
| UPDATE-SUPPLY | | Tracks token supply changes.|
| SUPPLY | | Tracks token supply changes.|

## Functions

State-Changing
set-max-balance-per-investor: Sets the maximum balance for investors.
set-supply-limit: Sets the supply limit.
set-max-investors: Sets the maximum number of investors.
set-compliance: Updates the compliance module.
set-compliance-parameters: Updates compliance parameters.
Getters
compliance: Fetches the compliance modules registered for the token.
get-compliance-parameters: Retrieves compliance parameters used in the compliance modules.
max-balance-per-investor: Retrieves the maximum allowable balance for investors.
supply-limit: Retrieves the maximum supply limit.
max-investors: Retrieves the maximum number of investors allowed.
investor-count: Retrieves the current investor count.
supply: Returns the current supply of tokens.
Utilities
update-supply: Adjusts the token supply.
add-investor-count: Increments the investor count.
remove-investor-count: Decrements the investor count.
sort-compliance: Sorts compliance list in alphabetical order
validate-compliance-parameters: Validates compliance parameters at set-compliance-parameters
enforce-unique-compliance: Validates that no duplicate compliance contracts are in the compliance list.

## Functions

The `mvp-token` contract defines the following functions:
