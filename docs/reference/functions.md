Pact provides a variety of operators for performing calculations, comparisons, and logical operations. Here's a quick overview of the available operators:

## Arithmetic Operators
- [+](operators/addition.md): Addition
- [-](operators/subtraction.md): Subtraction
- [*](operators/multiplication.md): Multiplication
- [/](operators/division.md): Division

## Comparison Operators
- [=](operators/equality.md): Equality
- [!=](operators/inequality.md): Inequality
- [`<`](operators/less-than.md): Less than
- [`<=`](operators/less-than-or-equal.md): Less than or equal to
- [`>`](operators/greater-than.md): Greater than
- [`>=`](operators/greater-than-or-equal.md): Greater than or equal to

## Logical Operators
- [and](operators/and.md): Logical AND
- [or](operators/or.md): Logical OR
- [not](operators/not.md): Logical NOT

## Bitwise Operators
- [&](operators/bitwise-and.md): Bitwise AND
- [|](operators/bitwise-or.md): Bitwise OR
- [~](operators/bitwise-not.md): Bitwise NOT
