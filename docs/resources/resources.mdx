# Resources

The Kadena Resources hub provides links to information and tools for developers, contributors, community members, and users.

These resources and related links are designed to help you:
- Understand and contribute to the Kadena ecosystem.
- Explore documentation for wallets, smart contracts, dApps, and tools.
- Stay updated with the latest developments in the Kadena network.

The resources currently available include the following:

- [Glossary](/resources/glossary) defines and explains concepts and terminology that are specific to decentralized computing, blockchain technology, Kadena, or the Kadena ecosystem.
- [Developer tools and solutions](resources/solutions) provides links to many developer tools and sample applications built for the Kadena blockchain.
- [Ecosystem projects and partners](/resources/ecosystem) highlight projects, partners, and Web3 solutions built for the Kadena blockchain with links to external documentation and websites.
- [Writer's style guide](resources/writing-guide) describes documentation conventions and recommended practices to follow for community members interested in contributing to Kadena documentation.
- [Contribute to documentation](/resources/contribute-doc) suggests some of the ways you can contribute to Kadena documentation as a community member and the process to follow if you decide to contribute.
- [Contribute as a developer](/resources/contribute-dev) hightlights how you can contribute to Kadena source code as a community member and the process to follow if you decide to contribute.
- [Kadena on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/kadenablockchain) includes recordings for all episodes of the Beyond thd Block video series.
- [Legacy documentation](/resources/legacy) provides a link to navigate to the previous version of the Kadena documentation site. 
   Note that the legacy site includes information and links that are out-of date as well as material that has been intentionally removed from the core documentation.
   For example, if you're interested in learning about the Kadena token standard defined in Marmalade smart contracts, you should review the [Non-fungible tokens](https://alpha-docs-fp4romh7i-kadena-js.vercel.app/build/nft-marmalade) documentation in the legacy site.
