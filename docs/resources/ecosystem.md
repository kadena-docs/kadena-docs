## RPC nodes

Remote procedure call (RPC) endpoints enables client computers and decentralized applications to interact with the blockchain network without participating in consensus, block validation, or block productions. 
RPC nodes provide services to blockchain users and applications by enabling those users and applications to retrieve onchain data, submit transactions, and execute smart contract functions.
