Missing something? Here is access to the old Kadena documentation for reference.

[Visit the Kadena legacy documentation site](https://alpha-docs-fp4romh7i-kadena-js.vercel.app)


Note that the legacy documentation site includes information and links that are out-of date as well as material that has been intentionally removed from the core documentation.
For example, if you're interested in learning about the Kadena token standard defined in Marmalade smart contracts, you should review the [Non-fungible tokens](https://alpha-docs-fp4romh7i-kadena-js.vercel.app/build/nft-marmalade) documentation in the legacy site.
