# Rotate authorized keys

The _Rotate authorized keys_ coding project demonstrates how to create a smart contract with rotatable authorization keys and how to enforce row level permissions.
This project continues to build on concepts and challenges presented in other coding projects and covered in [Smart contracts](/smart-contract-dev) topics.
Specifically, this project demonstrates the following:

- How you can use keysets as row level **guards** for assets.
- How to allow users to update information in tables based on their keyset.
- How to change ownership by rotating keyset values to authorize a new owner.

To implement these features, you'll create an `auth` module with four functions, one table, and two keysets:

## Before you begin

Before starting this project, verify your environment meets the following basic requirements:

- You have a GitHub account and can run `git` commands.
- You have installed the [Pact](/smart-contracts/install) programming language and command-line interpreter.
- You have installed the [`kadena-cli`](/smart-contracts/install/tooling#kadena-command-line-interface) package and have a working directory with initial configuration settings.
- You have a [local development](/smart-contracts/install/local-dev-node) node that you can connect to that runs the `chainweb-node` program, either in a Docker container or on a physical or virtual computer.
- You must have at least one [account](/guides/accounts/howto-fund-accounts) that's funded with KDA on at least one chain for deployment on the local development network or the Kadena test network.
- You should be familiar with the basics for defining [modules](/smart-contracts/modules) and using keysets.

## Get the starter code

To get started:

1. Open a terminal shell on your computer.

2. Clone the `pact-coding-projects` repository by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kadena-docs/pact-coding-projects.git
   ```

3. Change to the `02-rotate-auth` directory by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cd pact-coding-projects/02-rotate-auth
   ```

   If you list the contents of this directory, you'll see the following files:

   - `starter-auth.pact` provides a starting point with the framework for the project code and comments for every challenge.
   - `auth.pact` contains the final solution code that can be deployed.
   - `auth.repl` provides a complete test file for testing the final `auth.pact` contract.

4. Open and review the `starter-auth.pact` file.

   This file describes all of the tasks that you need to complete for the _Rotate authorized keys_ coding project.
   You can follow the instructions embedded in the file to try to tackle this coding project on your own without looking at the solutions to each step, or follow the instructions in the next sections if you need additional guidance.

## Define a namespace, keyset, and module

As you might have seen in other coding projects, modules are defined in a **namespace** and are governed by either an administrative keyset or a governance capability.

To simplify the initial code required, this coding project assumes you are defining a custom `dev` namespace for local development.
As an alternative, you could use the `free` namespace.
The `free` namespace is a publicly-available namespace that you can use to deploy smart contracts on the Kadena test network.
However, the best practice is to create a unique **principal namespace** where you can deploy all of your modules. 
Creating a principal namespace is covered later.

Like namespaces, keysets are defined outside of module code and passed into the module from message data that you provide separate from module code.

This coding project requires two keysets:

- The **module-admin** keyset allows authorized users to define and update modules.
- The **operate-admin** keyset allows authorized users to create user accounts.

To define the namespace, keysets, and module for this coding project:

1. Open the `starter-auth.pact` file in your code editor and save it as `auth.pact`.

2. Enter the `free` namespace as the workspace for the keysets and module.

    ```pact
   (namespace "dev")
   ```

3. Define and read the `module-admin` administrative keyset in the `free` namespace as the owner of the `auth` module.

   ```pact
   (define-keyset "dev.module-admin"
     (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset"))
   ```

4. Define and read the `operate-admin` operator keyset to control who can create new user accounts.

   ```pact
   (define-keyset "dev.operate-admin"
     (read-keyset "module-operate-keyset"))
   ```
5. Create a module named `auth` that is governed by an `AUTH` capability that enforces the administrative keyset.

   ```pact
   (module auth AUTH
    (defcap AUTH ()
     (enforce-guard "dev.module-admin"))

      ;; Module declaration
   )
   ```

6. Save your changes.

For more information about defining and reading keysets, see [define-keyset](/pact-5/keysets/define-keyset).
For more information about defining governance capabilities, see [Module governance](/smart-contracts/modules#module-governance).

## Define the schema and table

The `auth` modules stores information about user accounts in the `users-table` database table.
The schema for this table is named **user** with two columns:

| Field name | Field type |
| --------- | --------- |
| nickname  | string |
| keyset | guard |

To define the schema and table:

1. Open the modified `auth.pact` file in your code editor.

2. Define a `user` schema for a table with the columns `nickname` with the type of `string` and `keyset` with the type of `guard`.

   ```pact
   (defschema user
       nickname:string
       keyset:guard
   )
   ```

1. Define the `users-table` to use the `{user}` schema you created in the previous step.

   ```pact
   (deftable users-table:{user})
   ```

1. Move the closing parenthesis that marks the end of the `auth` module declaration after the table definition to include the schema and table inside of the module.

   Without comments, your code should look similar to the following:

   ```pact
   (define-namespace "dev" (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset") (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset"))
   (namespace "dev")

   (define-keyset "dev.module-admin" 
      (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset"))
   (define-keyset "dev.operate-admin"
      (read-keyset "module-operate-keyset"))
   
   (module auth AUTH
     (defcap AUTH ()
       (enforce-guard "dev.module-admin"))
   
     (defschema user
        nickname:string
        keyset:guard)
  
     (deftable users-table:{user})
   )  
   ```

For more information about creating schemas and tables, see the descriptions for the [defschema](/reference/syntax#defschema) and [deftable](/reference/syntax#deftable) keywords.

## Define functions

For this coding project, the `auth` module provides the following functions:

- `create-user` to allow users with the `operate-admin` keyset to add rows to the user table.
- `enforce-user-auth` to restrict access permissions to users with a given id.
- `change-nickname` to allow users with a specific keyset to update their nickname.
- `rotate-keyset` to allow the owner of a keyset to change the keyset being used.

These functions give users the ability to create and manage their own accounts.

### Define the create-user function

The `create-user` function specifies that only users with the `operate-admin` keyset can add rows to the user table.

To define the `create-user` function:

1. Open the modified `auth.pact` file in your code editor.

1. Start the `create-user` function definition with the keyword `defun` and add the parameters `id`, `nickname`, and `keyset`.

   ```pact
   (defun create-user:string (id:string nickname:string keyset:guard)

   )
   ```

2. Within the function, use `enforce-keyset` to restrict access to this function, so that new users can only be created by the `operate-admin` keyset.

   ```pact
     (enforce-guard "dev.operate-admin")
   ```

3. Within the function, insert a row into the `users-table` with the specified `nickname` and `keyset`.

   ```pact
     (insert users-table id {
        "keyset": keyset,
        "nickname": nickname
       }
     )
   ```

   Without comments, your code should look similar to the following:

   ```pact
   (define-namespace "dev" (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset") (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset"))
   (namespace "dev")

   (define-keyset "dev.module-admin" 
      (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset"))
   (define-keyset "dev.operate-admin"
      (read-keyset "module-operate-keyset"))
   
   (module auth AUTH
     (defcap AUTH ()
       (enforce-guard "dev.module-admin"))
   
     (defschema user
        nickname:string
        keyset:guard)
  
     (deftable users-table:{user})

     (defun create-user:string (id:string nickname:string keyset:keyset)
         (enforce-keyset "dev.operate-admin")
         (insert users-table id {
             "keyset": keyset,
             "nickname": nickname
           }
         )
      )
   )
   ```

For more information, see the descriptions for the [enforce-guard](/pact-5/general/enforce-guard) and [insert](/pact-5/database/insert) functions.

### Define the enforce-user-auth function

Itâ€™s sometimes useful to restrict access to specific data for specific users.
For example, you might want to prevent users from seeing account balances or other sensitive information that should be private.
In Pact, you can restrict access to specific rows in a table by using **row-level keysets**.

To define a row-level keyset, you must first be able to view the keyset associated with a specific key-row.
The following example demonstrates reading a keyset for a specified `id` key-row:

```pact
(defun enforce-keyset-of-id (id)
  (with-read table id { "keyset" := keyset }
  (enforce-guard keyset)
  keyset)
)
```

The purpose of this function is only to identify the keyset associated with the specified `id` key-row.
This function doesnâ€™t provide access to any of the data in the row.
However, other functions can call this function if they want to act on the information, for example, to place row-level restrictions on the data.

To define the `enforce-user-auth` function:

1. Open the modified `auth.pact` file in your code editor.

2. Start the `enforce-user-auth` function definition that takes the parameter `id`.

   ```pact
   (defun enforce-user-auth (id:string)

   )
   ```

3. Within the function, use `with-read` to read the `users-table` to find the specified `id`, and bind the `keyset` column for the `id` to the `k` variable, then return the `keyset` value with the `k` variable.

   ```pact
   (with-read users-table id { "keyset":= k }
      (enforce-guard k)
      k)
   ```

   Without comments, your code should look similar to the following:

   ```pact
   (define-namespace "dev" (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset") (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset"))
   (namespace "dev")

   (define-keyset "dev.module-admin" 
      (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset"))
   (define-keyset "dev.operate-admin"
      (read-keyset "module-operate-keyset"))
   
   (module auth AUTH
     (defcap AUTH ()
       (enforce-guard "dev.module-admin"))
   
     (defschema user
        nickname:string
        keyset:guard)
  
     (deftable users-table:{user})

     (defun create-user:string (id:string nickname:string keyset:keyset)
         (enforce-keyset "dev.operate-admin")
         (insert users-table id {
             "keyset": keyset,
             "nickname": nickname
           }
         )
      )

      (defun enforce-user-auth:guard (id:string)
          (with-read users-table id { "keyset":= k }
          (enforce-guard k)
          k)
       )
   )
   ```

For more information, see the descriptions for the [enforce-guard](/pact-5/general/enforce-guard) and [with-read](/pact-5/database/with-read) functions.

### Define the change-nickname function

After you define a function to restrict access to data, you can allow users to take specific actions based on the data they have access to.
For example, users might want to update their profile name, or make changes to sensitive information that other users should not be able to access.

To do that, you can write a function that calls the `enforce-user-auth` function to only allow users to update their own data.
For example, the following `update-data` function allows users to update existing information in the `example-table` by leveraging the `enforce-keyset-of-id` function:

```pact
(defun update-data (id new-data)
  (enforce-keyset-of-id id)
  (update example-table id { "data": new-data })
  (format "Data updated in row {} to {}" [id new-data]))
```

By calling the `enforce-keyset-of-id` function, this function allows users with a specific keyset to make updates to restricted information.

To define the `change-nickname` function:

1. Open the modified `auth.pact` file in your code editor.

2. Start the `change-nickname` function definition that takes the parameters `id` and `new-name`.

   ```pact
  (defun change-nickname:string (id:string new-name:string)
  )
  ```

2. Within the function, use the `enforce-user-auth` function to enforce authorization for the specified `id`.

   ```pact
   (enforce-user-auth id)
   ```

2. Within the function, call the `update` function to update the `nickname` column for the specified `id`.

   ```pact
   (update users-table id { "nickname": new-name })
   ```

1. Within the function, return a message to the user formatted as "Updated name for user [id] to [name]".

   ```pact
   (format "Updated name for user {} to {}" [id new-name])
   ```

   Without comments, your code should look similar to the following:

   ```pact
   (define-namespace "dev" (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset") (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset"))
   (namespace "dev")

   (define-keyset "dev.module-admin" 
      (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset"))
   (define-keyset "dev.operate-admin"
      (read-keyset "module-operate-keyset"))
   
   (module auth AUTH
     (defcap AUTH ()
       (enforce-guard "dev.module-admin"))
   
     (defschema user
        nickname:string
        keyset:guard)
  
     (deftable users-table:{user})

     (defun create-user:string (id:string nickname:string keyset:keyset)
         (enforce-keyset "dev.operate-admin")
         (insert users-table id {
             "keyset": keyset,
             "nickname": nickname
           }
         )
      )

      (defun enforce-user-auth:guard (id:string)
         (with-read users-table id { "keyset":= k }
         (enforce-guard k)
         k)
      )

      (defun change-nickname:string (id:string new-name:string)
         (enforce-user-auth id)
         (update users-table id { "nickname": new-name })
         (format "Updated name for user {} to {}" [id new-name])
      )
   )
   ```

For more information, see the descriptions for the [update](/pact-5/database/update) and [format](/pact-5/general/format) functions.

### Define the rotate-keyset function

Now that users can update their name, you can apply this same functionality to other information.
For this coding project, you can allow users to update their authorized keyset.
Being able to rotate the keyset is similar to being able to update your password.
For single key keysets, this feature enables a user to replace a potentially compromised key.
For keysets with multiple keys, this feature enables the set of owners or authorized signers to change when needed.

To define the `rotate-keyset` function:

1. Open the modified `auth.pact` file in your code editor.

2. Start the `rotate-keyset` function definition that takes the parameters `id` and `new-keyset`.

   ```pact
  (defun rotate-keyset:string (id:string new-keyset:string)
  )
  ```

2. Within the function, use the `enforce-user-auth` function to enforce authorization for the specified `id`.

   ```pact
   (enforce-user-auth id)
   ```

2. Within the function, call the `update` function to update the `keyset` column to the `new-keyset` for the specified `id`.

   ```pact
   (update users-table id { "keyset": new-keyset })
   ```

2. Within the function, return a message describing the update in the format "Updated keyset for user [id]".

   ```pact
   (format "Updated keyset for user {}" [id])
   ```

   Without comments, your code should look similar to the following:

   ```pact
   (define-namespace "dev" (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset") (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset"))
   (namespace "dev")

   (define-keyset "dev.module-admin" 
      (read-keyset "module-admin-keyset"))
   (define-keyset "dev.operate-admin"
      (read-keyset "module-operate-keyset"))
   
   (module auth AUTH
     (defcap AUTH ()
       (enforce-guard "dev.module-admin"))
   
     (defschema user
        nickname:string
        keyset:guard)
  
     (deftable users-table:{user})

     (defun create-user:string (id:string nickname:string keyset:keyset)
         (enforce-keyset "dev.operate-admin")
         (insert users-table id {
             "keyset": keyset,
             "nickname": nickname
           }
         )
      )

      (defun enforce-user-auth:guard (id:string)
         (with-read users-table id { "keyset":= k }
         (enforce-guard k)
         k)
      )

      (defun change-nickname:string (id:string new-name:string)
         (enforce-user-auth id)
         (update users-table id { "nickname": new-name })
         (format "Updated name for user {} to {}" [id new-name])
      )

      (defun rotate-keyset:string (id:string new-keyset:guard)
         (enforce-user-auth id)
         (update users-table id { "keyset": new-keyset})
         (format "Updated keyset for user {}" [id])
      )
   )
   ```

For more information about updating a table, see [Update](/smart-contracts/databases#update).

## Create table

Although you defined a schema and a table inside of the `auth` module, tables are created outside of the module code.
This distinction between what you define inside of the module and outside of the module is important because the module acts as a guard to protect access to database functions and records.
This separation also allows module code to be potentially updated without replacing the table in Pact state.

To create the table:

1. Open the modified `auth.pact` file in your code editor.

2. Locate the closing parenthesis for the `auth` module.

3. Create the table using the `create-table` reserved keyword.

   ```pact
   (create-table users-table)
   ```

The code for the _Rotate authorized keys_ smart contract is now complete.
From here, the next steps involve testing module functions, adding features, and deploying the contract in your local development environment or the Kadena public test network.

## Create a file for local testing

The most common way to test Pact modules is to create a `<module-name>.repl` file that uses REPL-only built-in functions to simulate data that must be provided by the environment, like keysets and signatures.
In this part of the project, you'll see how to create a test fileâ€”the `auth.repl` fileâ€”to call REPL-only functions to test the functions you've defined in the `auth` module.

To create the test file:

1. Create a new `auth.repl` file in your code editor.

1. Add a transaction that loads the `auth` module using the `begin-tx` and `commit-tx` built-in functions.
   
   ```pact
   (begin-tx)
     (load "auth.pact")
   (commit-tx)
   ```

2. Add a transaction that imports the `auth` module, sets environment data to simulate keyset information, and creates three test user accounts.

   ```pact
   ;; Import the "auth" module and set basic environment data.
   (begin-tx)
     (use auth)
     (env-data 
       {
         "admin-keyset" : ["admin"],
         "sarah-keyset": ["sarah"],
         "james-keyset": ["james"]
       }
     )
   ;; Use the create-user function to create three accounts.
     (create-user "admin" "Administrator" (read-keyset "admin-keyset"))
     (create-user "Sarah" "Sarah" (read-keyset "sarah-keyset"))
     (create-user "James" "James" (read-keyset "james-keyset"))
   
   (commit-tx)
   ```
   
3. Add a transaction to test the `enforce-user-auth` function with failure and successful scenarios.

   ```pact
   ;; Test an expected failure
   (begin-tx "Test enforce user authentication")
     (use dev.auth)

     (expect-failure "Keyset not in scope" "Keyset failure (keys-all)" (enforce-user-auth "Sarah"))
   
   ;; Specify the keyset and expect the operation to succeed
     (env-keys ["sarah"])
     (enforce-user-auth "Sarah")
   
   (commit-tx)
   ```   

3. Add a transaction to test the `change-nickname` function with failure and successful scenarios.

   ```pact
   (begin-tx "Test change nickname")
     (use dev.auth)
     (env-keys [""])
     (expect-failure "Keyset not in scope" "Keyset failure (keys-all)" (change-nickname "Sarah" "Sarah"))
   
     ;; Specify the keyset and expect the operation to succeed
     (env-keys ["sarah", "james"])
     (change-nickname "Sarah" "Sarah")
     (change-nickname "James" "James")
     (env-keys [""])
   (commit-tx)
   ```

3. Add a transaction to test the `rotate-keyset` function with failure and successful scenarios.

   ```pact
   (begin-tx "Test rotate keyset")
     (use dev.auth)
     (env-data 
       {
         "sarah-keyset": ["sarah"],
         "james-keyset": ["james"]
       }
      )

     (expect-failure "Keyset not in scope" 
       "Keyset failure (keys-all)" (rotate-keyset "Sarah" (read-keyset "sarah-keyset")))
     (expect-failure "Keyset not in scope" 
       "Keyset failure (keys-all)" (rotate-keyset "James" (read-keyset "james-keyset")))

     ;; Specify the keyset and expect the operation to succeed
     (env-keys ["sarah", "james"])
     (rotate-keyset "Sarah" (read-keyset "james-keyset"))
     (rotate-keyset "James" (read-keyset "sarah-keyset"))
   (commit-tx)
   ```

8. Open a terminal shell on your computer and test execution by running the following command:
   
   ```bash
   pact auth.repl --trace
   ```

   You should see output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   auth.repl:1:0-1:51:Trace: "Setting transaction keys"
   auth.repl:2:0-5:47:Trace: "Setting transaction data"
   auth.repl:11:0-11:10:Trace: "Begin Tx 0"

   You can also test functions interactively by loading the file into the Pact REPL.
   Type `pact` in a terminal shell to open the Pact REPL environment.

   ```bash
   pact> (env-keys ["admin", "moduleadmin", "operateadmin"])
   "Setting transaction keys"
   pact> (env-data{"module-admin-keyset": ["moduleadmin"],"module-operate-keyset": ["operateadmin"]})
   "Setting transaction data"
   pact> (load "auth.pact")
   "Loading auth.pact..."
   "Namespace defined: dev"
   "Namespace set to dev"
   "Keyset write success"
   "Keyset write success"
   Loaded module dev.auth, hash Wbu3gTpE0umJ5F_yNTzBq-puX0Ts78aUrYMA4-548y4
   "TableCreated"
   ```
   
   You can then set environment data and call functions interactively.
   For example, to create the `sarah` user:

   ```pact
   pact> (env-data{"sarah-keyset":["sarah-keyset"]})
   "Setting transaction data"
   pact> (dev.auth.create-user "sarah" "Sarah Rae Fitzpatrick" (read-keyset "sarah-keyset"))
   "Write succeeded"
   ```
   
## Deploy the contract

After testing the contract using the Pact interpreter and the REPL file, you can deploy the contract on your local development network or the Kadena test network.

However, you must deploy to an existing namespaceâ€”such as the `free` namespaceâ€”or a registered [principal namespace](/guides/transactions/howto-namespace-tx) to deploy on any Kadena network.
If you want to deploy in an existing namespace, you must also ensure that your module name and keyset name are unique across all of the modules that exist in that namespace.

In general, the best practice is to create a principal namespace for deploying your modules.

### Verify network, chain, and account information

Before you deploy on the local development network, verify the following:

- The development network is currently running on your local computer.

- You have at least one **account** with **funds** on at least one **chain** in the development network. 
   
  If you don't have keys and at least one account on any chain on the network, you need to generate keys, create an account, and fund the account on at least one chain before continuing.

- You have the public key for the account on the chain where you have funds.

### Create a principal namespace

For this coding project, you can define a principal namespace by executing a transaction using the following `simple-define-namespace.ktpl` transaction template.

```yaml
code: |-
  (define-namespace (ns.create-principal-namespace (read-keyset "k")) (read-keyset "k") (read-keyset "k"))
data:
  {
    "k": [
        "{{public-key}}"
    ]
  }
meta:
  chainId: "{{chain-id}}"
  sender: "{{{sender-account}}}"
  gasLimit: 80300
  gasPrice: 0.000001
  ttl: 600
signers:
  - public: "{{public-key}}"
    caps:
      - name: "coin.GAS"
        args: []
networkId: "{{network-id}}"
```

You can use `kadena tx add` to replace the variables in the template with the values for your public key, sender account, chain, and network.
For example:

```sh
? Which template do you want to use: simple-define-namespace.ktpl
? File path of data to use for template .json or .yaml (optional):
? Template value public-key: a6731ce7...93119689
? Template value chain-id: 3
? Template value sender-account: k:a6731ce7...93119689
? Template value network-id: development
? Where do you want to save the output: myNamespace
```

After you save the transaction to a file, you can use `kadena tx sign` to sign the transaction with your wallet password or public and secret keys.

After signing the transaction, you can use `kadena tx send` to send the transaction to the blockchain network.

After the transaction is complete, copy the principal namespace from the transaction results and use it to replace all occurrences of the original `"dev"` namespace.

```pact
(namespace "n_1cc1f83c56f53b8865cc23a61e36d4b17e73ce9e")
(define-keyset "n_1cc1f83c56f53b8865cc23a61e36d4b17e73ce9e.admin-keyset" (read-keyset "admin-keyset"))
(module payments "n_1cc1f83c56f53b8865cc23a61e36d4b17e73ce9e.admin-keyset" ...)
```

### Create a deployment transaction

You can deploy the `auth.pact` module on the local development network using the same workflow of `kadena tx add`, `sign`, and `send` commands that you used to execute the `define-namespace` transaction.

To deploy the module:

1. Create a new transaction template named `coding-project.ktpl` in the `~/.kadena/transaction-templates` folder.
   
   ```sh
   cd ~/.kadena/transaction-templates
   touch coding-project.ktpl
   ```

2. Open the `coding-project.ktpl` file in a code editor and create a reusable transaction request in YAML format similar to the following to specify the path to the `auth.pact` file that contains your Pact module code.
   
   ```pact
   codeFile: "../../auth.pact"
   data:
     module-admin-keyset:
       keys: ["{{admin-public-key}}"]
       pred: "keys-all"
     module-operate-keyset:
       keys: ["{{operate-public-key}}"]
       pred: "keys-all"
   meta:
     chainId: "{{chain-id}}"
     sender: "{{{sender-account}}}"
     gasLimit: 80300
     gasPrice: 0.000001
     ttl: 600
   signers:
     - public: "{{public-key}}"
       caps: []
   networkId: "{{network-id}}"
   ```

3. Create a transaction that uses the template by running the `kadena tx add` command and following the prompts displayed.

   For example:

   ```sh
   ? Which template do you want to use: coding-project.ktpl
   ? File path of data to use for template .json or .yaml (optional):
   ? Template value admin-public-key: a6731ce7...93119689
   ? Template value operate-public-key: 1d5a5e10...0b242ed4
   ? Template value chain-id: 3
   ? Template value sender-account: k:a6731ce7...93119689
   ? Template value public-key: a6731ce7...93119689
   ? Template value network-id: development
   ? Where do you want to save the output: auth-deploy
   ```

   In this example, the unsigned transaction is saved in a `auth-deploy.json` file.

4. Sign the transaction by running the `kadena tx sign` command and following the prompts displayed to sign with a wallet account or a public and secret key pair.
   
   For example:

   ```sh
   ? Select an action: Sign with wallet
   ? Select a transaction file: Transaction: auth-deploy.json
   ? 1 wallets found containing the keys for signing this transaction, please select a wallet to sign this transaction with first: Wallet: pistolas
   ? Enter the wallet password: ********
   ```

5. Send the transaction by running the `kadena tx send` command and following the prompts displayed.
   
   After the transaction is complete, you should see the message `TableCreated` in the transaction results.

### Create additional transactions

After you deploy the module, you can create additional transactions to verify contract functions running on the development network.
For example, you can create a transaction template for the `auth.create-user` function similar to the following:

```yaml
code: |-
  (n_1cc1f83c56f53b8865cc23a61e36d4b17e73ce9e.auth.create-user "{{user-id}}" "{{user-nickname}}" (read-keyset "{{user-guard}}"))
data:
  {{user-guard}}:
    keys:
      - "{{user-publicKey}}"
    pred: "{{user-predicate}}"
meta:
  chainId: "{{chain-id}}"
  sender: "{{sender-account}}"
  gasLimit: 2000
  gasPrice: 0.00000001
  ttl: 7200
signers:
  - public: "{{signer-public-key}}"
    caps: []
networkId: "{{networkId}}"
type: exec
```
   
With this template, you can create a transaction that adds the specified user `id`, `nickname`, and `guard` to the `users-table`.
For example, this template prompts you to provide the user details when you run `kadena tx add`:

```sh
Which template do you want to use: create-user.ktpl
? File path of data to use for template .json or .yaml (optional):
? Template value user-id: sarah
? Template value user-nickname: Sarah Rae Foster
? Template value user-guard: sarah-keyset
? Template value user-publicKey: 1d5a5e10...0b242ed4
? Template value user-predicate: keys-all
? Template value chain-id: 3
? Template value sender-account: k:1d5a5e10...0b242ed4
? Template value signer-public-key: 1d5a5e10...0b242ed4
? Template value networkId: development
? Where do you want to save the output: SARAH
```
