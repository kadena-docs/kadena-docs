# Coding projects

The **Coding projects** content area provides instructional material for working with the sample projects located in the `pact-coding-projects` repository.
The topics that correspond with the sample projects illustrate concepts in action and complement explanation topics with hands-on exercises and coding challenges. 
The projects themselves highlight common use cases that can be adapted to many scenarios or extended to address new use cases.

The `pact-coding-projects` repository includes the following sample projects for you to use as learning tools and basic how-to guides:

- ["Hello, World!" revisited](/coding-projects/hello-world) takes a closer look at your first contract and Pact syntax.
- [Simple payments](/coding-projects/transfers) illustrates how to create basic functions to work with accounts and balances.
- [Rotate authorized keys](/coding-projects/rotate-auth) demonstrates how to rotate keys and use row guards.
- [Contract interactions](/coding-projects/contract-interactions) provides an example of how to call functions that are defined in another module.
- [Gas station accounts](/coding-projects/gas-station) explains how to set up an account to pay transaction fees on behalf of other users.
- [Loans](/coding-projects/loans) highlights working with multiple tables and writing functions to manipulate data in tables.
- [Local testing](/coding-projects/local-testing) describes how to configure and use the Pact built-in server to format, sign, and submit transaction requests for local testing.
