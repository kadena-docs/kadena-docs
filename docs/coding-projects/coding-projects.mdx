# Coding projects

The **Coding projects** content area provides instructional material for working with the sample projects located in the `pact-coding-projects` repository.
The topics that correspond with the sample projects illustrate concepts in action and complement explanation topics with hands-on exercises and coding challenges. 
The projects themselves highlight common use cases that can be adapted to many scenarios or extended to address new use cases.

The `pact-coding-projects` repository includes the following sample projects for you to use as learning tools and basic how-to guides:

- Hello, World! revisited takes a closer look at your first contract and Pact syntax.
- Simple payment transfer illustrates working with accounts and balances.
- Rotatable wallet demonstrates now to rotate keys and use row guards.
- Contract dependencies provides examples for calling functions in one module from another module.
- Loan basics highlights working with multiple tables and manipulating data in tables.
- API requests (using a local server, formatting API requests)
