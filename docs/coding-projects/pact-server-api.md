# Pact built-in server

The _Pact built-in server_ coding project demonstrates how to use the Pact built-in REST API endpoints for testing transactions on a local server.
This coding project focuses on how to:

- Create a YAML configuration file for the Pact built-in local server.
- Create YAML execution API requests to submit transactions.
- Format YAML execution requests as JSON objects.
- Submit YAML requests using the Pact REST API endpoints.

By becoming familiar with how to perform these tasks, you'll be better prepared to develop a full stack application that combines a Pact smart contract backend with a Javascript-based front-end.

## Before you begin

Before starting this project, verify your environment meets the following basic requirements:

- You have a GitHub account and can run `git` commands.
- You have installed the Pact programming language and command-line interpreter.
- You have installed the `kadena-cli` package and have a working directory with initial configuration settings.
- You have a local development node that you can connect to that runs the `chainweb-node` program, either in a Docker container or on a physical or virtual computer.
- You should be familiar with defining modules and using keysets.

## Create a local working environment

For this coding project, there's no starter code.
Instead, you'll create a local working environment that includes the following:

- A local project directory.
- A local server configuration file.
- A sample transaction execution request using the YAML API request format.
- A directory for storing log files.

### Create a project folder

To create a project folder:

1. Open a terminal shell on your computer.

2. Create a new directory named `local-project` to hold the project files.

   ```bash
   mkdir deploy-tutorial
   ```

3. Change the directory to make the `local-project` folder your current working directory:

   ```bash
   cd local-project
   ```

### Create a configuration file

To create a server configuration file:

1. Create a new `pact-config.yaml` file for the local server configuration settings:

   ```bash
   touch pact-config.yaml
   ```

1. Open the `pact-config.yaml` file in your code editor and define the following configuration settings:

   ```bash
   # Configuration file for the Pact built-in HTTP server.

   # HTTP server port
   port: 8080

   # directory for HTTP logs
   logDir: http-log

   # persistence directory
   persistDir: http-log

   # SQLite pragmas for pact back-end
   pragmas: []

   # verbose: provide log output
   verbose: True
   ```

   You can also find the standard format for the Pact server configuration file in the [Pact repository](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/blob/master/config.yaml).
   The file provides the following fields to configure settings for the Pact built-in server:

   | Use this field | To do this |
   | :------------- | :--------- |
   | `port` | Specify the port number for the local Pact HTTP server to use. In this example, the port number `8080` is specified and is used as the port in all of the examples in this project. You can change this setting if you want to use a different. If this port is available in your local environment, you can leave this setting as it is.|
   | `logDir` | Specify the directory for HTTP logs should be stored. This setting specifies a folder location relative to the current directory. |
   | `persistDir` | Specify the directory for persistence data to be stored. This setting specifies a folder location relative to the current directory. |
   | `pragmas` | Specify the SQLite pragmas commands to control environmental variables or state flags within the Pact SQLite database.|
   | `verbose` | Specify whether you want the Pact server to log output. You can set this field to `true` to produce log files or false if don't want to produce log files. |

1. Save your changes and close the `pact-config.yaml` configuration file.

### Create a sample transaction file

To create a sample transaction file:

1. Create a new `transaction.yaml` file for the local server configuration settings:

   ```bash
   touch transaction.yaml
   ```

1. Open the `transaction.yaml` file in your code editor and define a sample execution request using the YAML API request format:

   ```bash
   code: "(+ 1 2)"
   data:
     name: Stuart
     language: Pact
   keyPairs:
     - public: ba54b224d1924dd98403f5c751abdd10de6cd81b0121800bf7bdbdcfaec7388d
       secret: 8693e641ae2bbe9ea802c736f42027b03f86afe63cae315e7169c9c496c17332
   ```

   In this example, the transaction includes one line of Pact code `1 + 2`, two data fields for the name `Stuart` and the language `Pact`, and a public and secret key pair that was generate by running the `pact --genkey` command.
   Transaction requests must always include either the `code` setting to specify the Pact code to execute or the `codeFile` setting to specify the path to a file that contains the Pact code to execute.
   The `data` setting is most commonly uses to specify keyset information.
   For example:

   ```bash
   codeFile: "deploy-hello.pact"
   data:
     sample-keyset: {
       keys: ["58705e8699678bd15bbda2cf40fa236694895db614aafc82cf1c06c014ca963c"],
       pred: "keys-all"
      }
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use a `dataFile` setting to specify the path to a file that contains the data for the transaction.

   The `keyPairs` setting lists key pairs to use for signing transaction.
   The key pairs are expected to be generated using the Ed25519 signature scheme that produces a base-16 public key and base-16 secret key.

   For more information about formatting API requests in YAML, see [Transaction formats](/smart-contracts/transactions#transaction-formats).

2. Save your changes and close the `transaction.yaml` file.

### Create a directory for logging

To create a directory for logging:

1. Open a terminal shell on your computer and navigate to the `local-project` folder, if necessary.

2. Create a new directory named `http-log` to hold the log files.

   ```bash
   mkdir http-log
   ```

3. Check the contents of the directory to verify you have the log directory and YAML files.

   ```bash
   ls -l
   ```

   The command should display output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   total 16
   drwxr-xr-x  2 pistolas  staff   64 Jan  6 15:33 http-log
   -rw-r--r--  1 pistolas  staff  279 Jan  6 15:33 pact-config.yaml
   -rw-r--r--  1 pistolas  staff  218 Jan  6 15:31 transaction.yaml
   ```

## Start the local server

Now that you have a working environment, you are ready to start the Pact server and use the local Pact REST API endpoints to test transactions.

To start the local server:

1. Open a terminal shell on your computer and navigate to the `local-project` folder, if necessary.

2. Start the local server using the settings you defined in the pact-config.yaml file.

   ```bash
   pact --serve pact-config.yaml
   ```

   After running this command, you should see the Pact server initialized and running on port 8080 with output similar to the following:

   ```bash

   2025/01/06-15:44:02 [disk replay]: No replay found
   ```

   You can now call Pact REST API endpoints using the local server.

## Call REST API endpoints

You can use the local Pact server to call the following Pact REST API endpoints:

| Use this endpoint | To do this |
| :---------------- | :--------- |
| `/send` | Submit a transaction that contains a `cmd` object in JSON format and return a transaction hash. This transaction hash is the same string as the **request key** you can use to look up transaction results. |
| `/listen` | Specify a single transaction hash and return the transaction result. |
| `/poll` | Specify multiple transaction hashes in a single request and return multiple transaction results.|
| `/local` |Submit a transaction that contains a `cmd` object that queries the blockchain but only runs in the local server and return the transaction result. |

### Send

Now that the Pact server is running, you can use the terminal to call the `/send` endpoint locally.
To call the `/send` endpoint, you must:

- Convert the YAML request in the transaction.yaml file into a JSON `cmd` object.
- Include the `cmd` object in the request body in the API request.

To call the `/send` endpoint:

1. Open a new terminal shell on your computer.

2. Navigate to the `local-project` folder.

3. Convert the YAML request in the transaction.yaml file into a JSON cmd object.

   ```bash
   pact --apireq transaction.yaml
   ```

   This command formats the sample transaction file and displays the JSON output similar to the following in the terminal:

   ```bash
   {"cmds":[{"hash":"KVe1Kw3IvlS_hkf95Hsa2yjC0AQCXGlI2ZVXVcUfT88","sigs":[{"sig":"7c35dad8a8990642bfe7331cd2553ca1a27828bc29b29257ece286ac0a52c3958da24102496d708d479c544136d1553f954e962239c0f48d5eebe87131360e0e"}],"cmd":"{\"networkId\":null,\"payload\":{\"exec\":{\"data\":{\"name\":\"Stuart\",\"language\":\"Pact\"},\"code\":\"(+ 1 2)\"}},\"signers\":[{\"pubKey\":\"ba54b224d1924dd98403f5c751abdd10de6cd81b0121800bf7bdbdcfaec7388d\"}],\"meta\":{\"creationTime\":0,\"ttl\":0,\"gasLimit\":0,\"chainId\":\"\",\"gasPrice\":0,\"sender\":\"\"},\"nonce\":\"2025-01-07 00:10:12.876201 UTC\"}"}]}
   ```

4. Call the `/send` endpoint using a `curl` command similar to the following:

   ```bash
   pact --apireq transaction.yaml | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/send
   ```

   This command formats that YAML transaction, specifies the request header for the `Content-Type` to be `application/json`, then specifies the destination for the API call.
   In this case, the API call is sent to the `localhost` on port `8080`.

   This command returns the request key for the transaction in the response:

   ```bash
   {"requestKeys":["Mvn7OBApUVCck9lPzvNJjwd2gBeq6ZFEJnXTI-R0hQQ"]}
   ```

   Each request generates a unique transaction hash, so your request key will be different from the example.

### Listen

You can use the `/listen` endpoint to request the transaction result for a single transaction hash.
The format for calling the `/listen` endpoint looks similar to the following:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"listen":"Mvn7OBApUVCck9lPzvNJjwd2gBeq6ZFEJnXTI-R0hQQ"}' -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/listen
```

This command returns the result of the request with output similar to the following:

```bash
{"gas":0,"result":{"status":"success","data":3},"reqKey":"Mvn7OBApUVCck9lPzvNJjwd2gBeq6ZFEJnXTI-R0hQQ","logs":"wsATyGqckuIvlm89hhd2j4t6RMkCrcwJe_oeCYr7Th8","metaData":null,"continuation":null,"txId":1}
```

### Poll

You can use the `/poll` endpoint to request the transaction results for multiple transactions with a single call.
The `/poll` endpoint is similar to the `/listen` endpoint except that the connection is intended to run at an interval instead of remain open and accepts multiple request key hashes in the request and returns multiple transaction results.

The format for calling the `/poll` endpoint looks similar to the following with a list of the request keys you received in response from calling the `/send` endpoint:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"requestKeys":["Mvn7OBApUVCck9lPzvNJjwd2gBeq6ZFEJnXTI-R0hQQ", "5Fu1m0crUk7MKL0Yyjg3gMPGcKuC0U4dx5Z5kBEQUz8",
"18_CToCa_JXDvOPIHF-CceDw9gCpEMbpJKgLmot7I9M", "pdjiSC6IN_enbolWiuLVynXYVv1os8E9YfptltXjckU"]}' -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/poll
```

This command returns the result of the request with output similar to the following:

```bash
{"5Fu1m0crUk7MKL0Yyjg3gMPGcKuC0U4dx5Z5kBEQUz8":{"gas":0,"result":{"status":"success","data":3},"reqKey":"5Fu1m0crUk7MKL0Yyjg3gMPGcKuC0U4dx5Z5kBEQUz8","logs":"wsATyGqckuIvlm89hhd2j4t6RMkCrcwJe_oeCYr7Th8","metaData":null,"continuation":null,"txId":1}}
```

The difference between the `/listen` and `/poll` endpoints is subtle, but important.
You only use the `/listen` endpoint if you are working with a single hash to return the result.
You use the `/poll` endpoint if you want to request the results for multiple transactions.

### Local

You can use the `/local` endpoint to submit queries to the blockchain without affecting the blockchain state.
The `/local` endpoint is similar to the /send endpoint in that it includes a `cmd` object with code in the request and returns the transaction result.
However, the transaction you submit using the /local endpoint only runs in local server and does not update any nodes in the blockchain network.

The format for calling the `/local` endpoint looks similar to the following:

```bash
pact --apireq transaction.yaml --local | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/local
```

This command returns output that's similar to the output from the /send endpoint:

```bash
{"gas":0,"result":{"status":"success","data":3},"reqKey":"ch8h1qrsqpOtt9mIhwi1vGXM8QKc53OIGEpKUF3Yz80","logs":"wsATyGqckuIvlm89hhd2j4t6RMkCrcwJe_oeCYr7Th8","metaData":null,"continuation":null,"txId":null}
```

The `/local` endpoint is particularly useful if you want to execute a function that doesn’t need to change the state of the blockchain.
In general, you should use the `/local` endpoint if you want to call functions that retrieve information from tha blockchain.
Yoi should use the `/send` endpoint if you want to update information stored in the blockchain or to deploy smart contracts on the blockchain.

## Write and execute YAML requests

At this point, you have learned how to start a local Pact server and how to use the REST API endpoints to update or retrieve information from the blockchain.
The next step is to apply what you've learned to write your own YAML request files, convert the requests to JSON, and execute the transactions using the REST API endpoints.
To finish this coding project, write and execute YAML request files for the following transactions:

- Deploy the `helloWorld` contract.
- Call the `say-hello` function.

For this exercise, add the following smart contract to create a `hello-world.pact` file in your `local-project` folder:

```pact
(module helloWorld GOVERNANCE
    "You can also embed comments in smart contracts by using quoted strings."

    (defcap GOVERNANCE () true)
      (defun say-hello(name:string)
        (format "Hello, {}! ~ from Kadena" [name])
    )
)
```

If you list the contents of the `local-project` folder, you should see the following files and folder:

```bash
total 24
-rw-r--r--  1 pistolas  staff  236 Jan  7 10:11 hello-world.pact
drwxr-xr-x  4 pistolas  staff  128 Jan  6 16:19 http-log
-rw-r--r--  1 pistolas  staff  279 Jan  6 15:33 pact-config.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 pistolas  staff  218 Jan  6 15:31 transaction.yaml

```

To write and execute YAML requests:

1. Generate a public and secret key pair to sign transactions using a command similar to the following:

   ```bash
   pact --genkey > pistolas.keys
   ```

   This command create a `pistolas.keys` file with a public and secret key.
   For example:

   ```bash
   public: 6392582fe63bd6bb28d55f02e8ec75d0a668ba7b1065076ca1a630f470009f68
   secret: 06fe72b8deaf96ba21734535bfb8c7e062d64b672b1c7d5179d67b7d363a3b13
   ```

   Note that, in this example, you’re submitting requests to the built-in Pact server endpoints.
   If you were deploying contracts or calling functions on the Kadena development, test, or production network, your YAML request file would need to include additional information such as the network identifier and chain identifier.
   You can find examples of more complete YAML request files in the [How to](/guides) guides.

2. Write a minimal `deploy-hello-world.yaml` file that deploys the `hello-world.pact` file.

   ```yaml
   # Deploy ‘Hello, world! smart contract’

   codeFile: hello-world.pact
   data:
   keyPairs:
     - public: 6392582fe63bd6bb28d55f02e8ec75d0a668ba7b1065076ca1a630f470009f68
       secret: 06fe72b8deaf96ba21734535bfb8c7e062d64b672b1c7d5179d67b7d363a3b13
   ```

1. Deploy the contract by calling the `/send` endpoint.

   ```bash
   pact --apireq deploy-hello-world.yaml | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/send
   ```

   The command returns the request key.
   For example:

   ```bash
   {"requestKeys":["7tq7i9cqTdTOA4GDoBkMDtq8aXFD3xXei_R85NWsQdA"]}
   ```

2. Listen for the transaction result by calling the `/listen` endpoint.

   ```bash
   curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"listen":"7tq7i9cqTdTOA4GDoBkMDtq8aXFD3xXei_R85NWsQdA"}' -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/listen
   ```

   The command returns the transaction result.
   For example:

   ```bash
   {"gas":0,"result":{"status":"success","data":"Loaded module helloWorld, hash JzE-eJ5v2GdSBbcrv5eHUN0zBARx31RpiQfAXKmLD_s"},"reqKey":"7tq7i9cqTdTOA4GDoBkMDtq8aXFD3xXei_R85NWsQdA","logs":"_PWOYLBV0TVmcdaTl3FnwEeYFETdE6Cs6pvB9I4kZGA","metaData":null,"continuation":null,"txId":1}
   ```

3. Write a `call-say-hello.yaml` file that calls the `say-hello` function.

   ```yaml
   # Call the say-hello-function

   code: (helloWorld.say-hello "San Francisco, CA")
   data:
   keyPairs:
     - public: 6392582fe63bd6bb28d55f02e8ec75d0a668ba7b1065076ca1a630f470009f68
       secret: 06fe72b8deaf96ba21734535bfb8c7e062d64b672b1c7d5179d67b7d363a3b13
   ```

1. Submit a transaction that calls the function by using the `/send` endpoint.

   ```bash
   pact --apireq call-say-hello.yaml | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/send
   ```

   The command returns the request key.
   For example:

   ```bash
   {"requestKeys":["5HW7PI3eqrKt4zKVTk5HdFVO0_GGmtQJr7AJwZ_xOto"]}
   ```

2. Listen for the transaction result by calling the `/listen` endpoint with the request key returned.

   ```bash
   curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"listen":"5HW7PI3eqrKt4zKVTk5HdFVO0_GGmtQJr7AJwZ_xOto"}' -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/listen
   ```

   The command returns the transaction result.
   For example:

   ```bash
   {"gas":0,"result":{"status":"success","data":"Hello, San Francisco, CA! ~ from Kadena"},"reqKey":"5HW7PI3eqrKt4zKVTk5HdFVO0_GGmtQJr7AJwZ_xOto","logs":"wsATyGqckuIvlm89hhd2j4t6RMkCrcwJe_oeCYr7Th8","metaData":null,"continuation":null,"txId":4}
   ```

## Review

In this coding project, you created a project directory with a local server configuration file and a sample transaction YAML request file.
You also created a **http-log** folder for SQLite data from the Pact server and started the Pact server locally on port number 8080.
After starting the server, you used the `pact --apireq` command to convert the sample YAML request file into a JSON `cmd` object and used `curl` commands to send the `cmd` object to the Pact server.

Now that you know how to write and submit transaction requests and how to look up transaction results and submit local queries, you can begin developing more sophisticated applications to run on the Kadena blockchain.
