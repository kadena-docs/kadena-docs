Time functions are used to manage and manipulate time-based information and formats.

| Function | Description |
| :-------- | :----------- |
| [add&#8209;time](/pact-5/time/add-time) | Add a specified number of seconds to a time.|
| [days](/pact-5/time/days) | Specify a number of days to add or subtract days from a given time.|
| [diff&#8209;time](/pact-5/time/diff-time) | Compute the difference in seconds between two specified times.|
| [format&#8209;time](/pact-5/time/format-time) | Format a time value using a specified format.|
| [hours](/pact-5/time/hours) |  Add a specific number of hours to a given time.|
| [minutes](/pact-5/time/minutes) | Add a specific number of minutes to a given time.|
| [parse&#8209;time](/pact-5/time/parse-time) | Construct time from a UTC value using a specified format. |
| [time](/pact-5/time/time.md) | Construct a time object from a UTC value using the `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` format.|

## Time formats

The `parse-time` and `format-time` functions accept format codes that are derived from the formatting time `strftime` function time templates with some extensions.
You can use the following template specifiers that are introduced by using a single percentage (`%`) character to format time strings:

| Specifier | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| `%a` | The abbreviated short name for the day of the week as specified for the current locale, for example,`"Sun"`–`"Sat"`. |
| `%A` | The full name for the day of the week as specified for the current locale, for example, `"Sunday"`–`"Saturday"`. |
| `%b` | The abbreviated month name as specified for the current locale, for example, `"Jan"`–`"Dec"`. |
| `%B` | The full month name as specified for the current locale, for example, `"January"`–`"December"`. |
| `%c` | The preferred calendar time representation as specified for the current locale, for example, `%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y`.|
| `%C` | The century of the year with no padding.|
| `%d` | The day of the month as a decimal number zero-padded to two characters, for example, `"01"`–`"31"`.|
| `%D` | The date using the format `%m/%d/%y`.|
| `%e` | The day of the month as a decimal number space-padded to two characters, for example, `" 1"`–`"31"`.|
| `%f` | Century for the week date format with no padding.|
| `%F` | The date using the format `%Y-%m-%d` as specified in the ISO 8601 standard.|
| `%g` | The year corresponding to the ISO week number, without the century, zero-padded to two characters, for example, `"00"`–`"99"`.|
| `%G` | The year corresponding to the ISO week number with no padding.|
| `%h` | The abbreviated month name as specified for the current locale, for example, `"Jan"`–`"Dec"`. This format is the same as using the `%b` template.|
| `%H` | The hour of the day as a decimal number, using a 24-hour clock, zero-padded to two characters, for example, `"00"`–`"23"`.|
| `%I` | The hour of the day as a decimal number, using a 12-hour clock, zero-padded to two characters, for example, `"01"`–`"12"`.|
| `%j` | The day of the year as a decimal number, zero-padded to three characters, for example, `"001"`–`"366"`.|
| `%k` | The hour of the day as a decimal number, using a 24-hour clock, space-padded to two characters, for example, `" 0"`–`"23"`.|
| `%l` | The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock, space-padded to two characters, for example, `" 1"`–`"12"`.|
| `%m` | The month of the year, zero-padded to two characters, for example, `"01"`–`"12"`.|
| `%M` | The minute of the hour, zero-padded to two characters, for example, `"00"`–`"59"`.|
| `%N` | Numeric representation of the time zone using the ISO 8601 standard, for example, `"-06:00"` or `"+01:00"`.|
| `%p` | The half of day representation of `"AM"` or `"PM"` or the corresponding strings specified for the current locale. Noon is treated as ‘PM’ and midnight as ‘AM’. If `"AM"` and `"PM"` aren't supported, the `%p` template returns an empty string.|
| `%P` | The half of day representation of `"AM"` or `"PM"` or the corresponding strings specified for the current locale, converted to lowercase, for example, `"am"` and `"pm"`. Noon is treated as ‘PM’ and midnight as ‘AM’. If `"am"` and `"pm"` aren't supported, the `%P` template returns an empty string.|
| `%Q` | The fraction of a second, up to six second decimal places, without trailing zeros. For a whole number of seconds, `%Q` produces an empty string.|
| `%r` | The complete calendar time including the AM/PM format as specified for the current locale, for example, `%I:%M:%S %p`.|
| `%R` | The hour and minute in decimal numbers using the format `%H:%M`.|
| `%s` | The number of whole seconds since the UNIX epoch (since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC). For times before the UNIX epoch, this is a negative number. Note that in `%s.%q` and `%s%Q` formats, the decimals are positive, not negative. For example, 0.9 seconds before the UNIX epoch is formatted as `"-1.1"` with `%s%Q`.|
| `%S` | The seconds of a minute, zero-padded to two characters, for example, `"00"`–`"60"`.|
| `%T` | The time of day using the format `%H:%M:%S`.|
| `%u` | The day of the week as a number with Monday being 1, for example, `"1"`–`"7"`.|
| `%U` | The week number of the year as a number, starting with the first Sunday as the first day of the first week, zero-padded to two characters, for example, `"00"`–`"53"`.|
| `%v` | The microsecond of a second, zero-padded to six characters, for example, `"000000"`–`"999999"`.|
| `%V` | The week number as specified using the ISO 8601:1988 standard where weeks start with Monday and end with Sunday. zero-padded to two characters, for example,`"01"`–`"53"`.|
| `%w` | The day of the week as a number, starting with Sunday as 0, for example,`"0"` (= Sunday) – `"6"` (= Saturday).|
| `%W` | The week number of the year as a number (range 00 through 53), starting with the first Monday as the first day of the first week. zero-padded to two characters, for example, `"00"`–`"53"`.|
| `%x` | The preferred date representation as specified for the current `locale`, for example, `%m\/%d\/%y`.|
| `%X` | The preferred time of day representation as specified for the current locale, for example, `%H:%M:%S`.|
| `%y` | The year without a century as a number, zero-padded to two characters, for example, `"00"`–`"99"`.|
| `%Y` | The full year as a number with no padding.|
| `%z` | Numeric representation of the time zone using the RFC 822/ISO 8601:1988 standard, for example, `"-0600"` or `"+0100"`.|
| `%Z` | The time zone abbreviation or empty if the time zone can't be determined.|

Note that two percentage characters (`%%`) are interpreted as a literal percentage sign (`%`), not a time formatting template.
In addition, the template for picoseconds with zero padding (`%q`) doesn't work properly, so it's not included as a supported template for formatting time strings.

## Default format and JSON serialization

The default time format in Pact is the ISO 8601 standard Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) date time format:

```text
%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ
```

This format accepted by the `time` function.
Internally, the time object supports up to microsecond resolution.
However, the values returned from the Pact interpreter as JSON are be serialized using the default format.
If you need higher resolution, you can explicitly format times withthe `%v` template and related codes.
