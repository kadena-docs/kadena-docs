## map

Use `map` to apply an application function (`app`) to each element in a list (`list`), returning a new list of results.

You can use any data type for the `list` argument as long as the first `app` function can take that same data type.
By convention, data type notation like `<a>` and `<b>` are used to represent type-bound parameters that serve as input for functions and expressions or for generic arguments.

### Basic syntax

To apply an application function to each element in a list, use the following syntax:

```pact
(map app list)
```

### Arguments

Use the following arguments to specify the application function and the list of elements to be mapped using the `map` Pact function.

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app` | function x:`<b> -> <a>` | Specifies the application function to be applied to each element in the list. |
| `list` | `[<b>]` | Specifies the list of elements to be mapped. |

### Return value

The `map` function returns a new list containing the results of applying the application function to each element in the input list.

### Examples

The following example demonstrates the use of `map` in the Pact REPL:

```pact
pact>(map (+ 1) [1 2 3])
[2 3 4]
```

In this example, the application function `(+ 1)` is applied to each element in the list `[1 2 3]`, resulting in a new list `[2 3 4]`.
