# Configure node settings

You can customize many features and operations for any Chainweb node that you're responsible for managing, including local development nodes.
You can review the current configuration for a node by displaying or generating a configuration file using the `--print-config` command-line option.
For example, to display the current configuration settings as standard output, run the following command:

```bash
./chainweb-node --print-config
```

There are two ways you can modify chainweb-node configuration settings:

- By specifying command-line operations.
- By passing one or more configuraiton files when starting the node.

To generate a configuration file that you can then edit, run a command similar to the following:

```bash
./chainweb-node --print-config > chainweb-config.yaml
```

This section provides an overview of settings you can modify in a configuration file.
Configuration settings are loaded in order first from one or more configuration file locations that you specify using `--config-file` options, then from the command-line options in the order you specify them.
Configuration settings that are loaded later overwrite settings that were previously loaded.
You can specify configuration file locations by providing local file system paths or remote HTTP or HTTPS URLs. 
Remote URLs must start with either "http://" or "https://".

For information about modifying configuration settings by specifying command-line options, see [chainweb-node command-line](/reference/chainweb-cli).

## Chainweb settings

The following settings are defined as properties under the `chainweb` key.

```yaml
chainweb:
  allowReadsInLocal: false
```

Set to true if you want to allow read operations in local execution mode.

```yaml
  backup:
    api:
      configuration: {}
      enabled: false
    directory: null
```

Set enabled to true to configure backup settings. 
By default, the backup API is disabled and there's no backup directory specified.

```yaml
  chainwebVersion: mainnet01
```

Specifies the Chainweb network identifier. 
The valid values are development, testnet04, testnet05, and mainnet01.
The default is mainnet01.

```yaml
  cuts:
    fastForwardBlockHeightLimit: null
    fetchTimeout: 3000000
    initialBlockHeightLimit: null
    pruneChainDatabase: none
```

In the Kadena network, a cut height represents the distributed state from a Chainweb node. 
You can use the settings under the `cut` key to control the following cut properties:

- fastForwardBlockHeightLimit to set a limit for fast-forwarding the block height (null means no limit).
- fetchTimeout to set a tmeout for fetching cuts in microseconds.
- initialBlockHeightLimit to set an initial block height limit (null means no limit).
- pruneChainDatabase to set a database pruning strategy. You can specify the pruning strategy as none, headers, headers-checked, or full.

```yaml
  enableLocalTimeout: false
```

Set to true to enable local timeout.

```yaml
  fullHistoricPactState: true
```
Set to true to maintain full historical Pact state.

```yaml
  gasLimitOfBlock: 150000
```
Sets the gas limit for each block.

```yaml
  headerStream: false
```
Set to true to enable header streaming for indexing or streaming data.

```yaml
  logGas: false
```
Set to true to log gas usage.

```yaml
  mempoolP2p:
    configuration:
      maxSessionCount: 6
      pollInterval: 30
      sessionTimeout: 300
    enabled: true
```
You can use the settings under the `mempoolP2p` key to control the following peer-to-peer mempool properties:

- maxSessionCount to set the maximum number of concurrent sessions.
- pollInterval to set the interval for polling the mempool for pending transactions in seconds.
- sessionTimeout to set the session timeout in seconds.
- enabled to enable or disable the peer-to-peer mempool.

```yaml
  minGasPrice: 1.0e-8
```
Set the minimum gas price.

```yaml
  mining:
    coordination:
      enabled: false
      limit: 1200
      miners: []
      payloadRefreshDelay: 15000000
      updateStreamLimit: 2000
      updateStreamTimeout: 240
    nodeMining:
      enabled: false
      miner:
        account: ''
        predicate: keys-all
        public-keys: []
```
You can use the settings under the `mining` key to control the coordinated mining and node mining properties.
In this example, mining is disabled for the node.

```yaml
  moduleCacheLimit: 62914560
```
Set the module cache limit in bytes.

```yaml
  onlySyncPact: false
```
Set to true to only synchronize Pact data.

```yaml
  p2p:
    bootstrapReachability: 0.5
    ignoreBootstrapNodes: false
    maxPeerCount: 50
    maxSessionCount: 10
    peer:
      certificateChain: null
      certificateChainFile: null
      hostaddress:
        hostname: 0.0.0.0
        port: 1789
      interface: '*'
      key: null
      keyFile: null
    peers: []
    private: false
    sessionTimeout: 240
```
You can use the settings under the `p2p` key to control the following peer-to-peer properties:

- bootstrapReachability to set a threshold for bootstrap node reachability.
- maxPeerCount to set the maximum number of peers for the node to communicate with.
- peer to define specific peer settings including host address and port.
- peers to sepcify a list of known peers (empty here).
- private to specify whether the node is private.
