# Monitor node status

This guide explains how to set up basic monitoring to check the status of a Chainweb node using a bash script, how to add notifications to the script, and how to run the script regularly.

## Basic health check

The following sample script illustrates how you can create a `bash` script that checks the status of a Chainweb node and restarts it, if necessary:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Define environment variables with default values if not already set
export CHAINWEB_NETWORK=${CHAINWEB_NETWORK:-mainnet01}
export CHAINWEB_PORT=${CHAINWEB_P2P_PORT:-2022}
SERVICE_NAME="kadena-node.service" # Replace with your service
LOG_FILE="/var/log/chainweb/service.log"

# Function to log messages with timestamps
log_message() {
    echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

# Function to check the service status
check_service_status() {
    curl -fsLk --connect-timeout 10 "https://localhost:$CHAINWEB_PORT/chainweb/0.0/$CHAINWEB_NETWORK/cut"
}

# Function to restart the service and log the outcome
restart_service() {
    if systemctl restart "$SERVICE_NAME"; then
        log_message "Successfully restarted the Chainweb service."
    else
        log_message "Failed to restart the Chainweb service."
        exit 1  # Exit with an error status if the restart fails
    fi
}

# Main logic to check service status and potentially restart the service
if check_service_status; then
    log_message "Chainweb service is running."
else
    log_message "Chainweb service might be down. Attempting to restart..."
    restart_service
fi
```

This script does the following:
- Sets up environment variables for the Chainweb network and port.
- Defines functions for logging, checking service status, and restarting the service.
- Checks if the Chainweb service is running by querying its API.
- If the service is down, it attempts to restart it.

## Adding notifications

To add notifications, you can modify the `log_message` function to send emails or messages to services like Telegram.
Here's an example of how you might modify the function to send a Telegram message:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token"
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="your_chat_id"

log_message() {
    message="$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1"
    echo "$message" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    curl -s -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/sendMessage" \
         -d chat_id="$TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID" \
         -d text="$message"
}
```

Replace `your_bot_token` and `your_chat_id` with your actual Telegram bot token and chat ID.

## Additional checks

You can add more robust checks to ensure your node is functioning correctly. 
For example, you could add a function to perform a local call to validate functionality.

## Running the script regularly

In most case, you should establish a schedule for monitoring nodes are a regular interval.
For example, to run the sample script every 30 seconds, you can set up a `cron` job or a `systemd` timer.

### Using cron

To set up a `cron` job for monitoring a node:

1. Open your crontab file for editing by running the following command:
   
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

1. Add an instruction for running the monitoring script similar to the following line:

   ```bash
   * * * * * /path/to/your/monitor-node-script.sh; sleep 30; /path/to/your/monitor-node-script.sh
   ```

   This instructiopn runs the `monitor-node-script.sh` script every minute and then again 30 seconds later.

### Using systemd

To set up a `systemd` timer for monitoring a node:

1. Create a `/etc/systemd/system/chainweb-monitor.service` service file similar to the following:
   
   ```bash
   [Unit]
   Description=Chainweb Node Monitor
   
   [Service]
   ExecStart=/path/to/your/script.sh
   
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

1. Create a `/etc/systemd/system/chainweb-monitor.timer` timer file similar to the following:
   
   ```bash
   [Unit]
   Description=Run Chainweb Node Monitor every 30 seconds
   
   [Timer]
   OnBootSec=30
   OnUnitActiveSec=30s
   
   [Install]
   WantedBy=timers.target
   ```

1. Enable the timer by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable chainweb-monitor.timer
   ```

1. Start the timer by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start chainweb-monitor.timer
   ```
   
   This timer runs the monitoring script every 30 seconds, providing real-time information about the status of the Chainweb node.
   The script also automatically attempts to restart the node, if issues are detected.
