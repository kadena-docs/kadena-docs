## Tips for Crafting Blockchain Calls

1. **Use the Correct Chain ID**: Kadena is a multi-chain system. Ensure you're using the correct chain ID for your transaction.

2. **Gas Management**: Always set appropriate gas limit and price to ensure your transaction is processed.

3. **Nonce Handling**: For API calls, include a unique nonce to prevent duplicate transactions.

4. **Error Handling**: Always check the response for any errors or unexpected results.

5. **Security**: Never share your private keys. When using API calls, ensure you're using a secure connection (https).

Remember, these are simplified examples. In a production environment, you'd need to handle signing, error checking, and other details more robustly.
